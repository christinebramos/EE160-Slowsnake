	For this final project, we had to meet both in person and online due
to busy schedules. To help with the project, I created comments and provided
concepts on how to approach certain problems with coding. Jared and Anthony,
being more advanced in coding did majority of the coding while I reviewed and
checked for errors. Although I was late to a meeting due to an audition, I
still made sure to do as much as I could even after Anthony and Jared had
already completed majority of the program. Overall, I think that we work well
as a group and all perform to the best of our abilities.
